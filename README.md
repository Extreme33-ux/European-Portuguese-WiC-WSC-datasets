 The **Word-in-Context (WiC)** task tests a computerâ€™s ability to understand the meaning of a word in different sentences. The goal is to decide if the same word in two different sentences has the same meaning or not.  

 The **Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC)** is a task that tests a computer's ability to understand language by determining what a pronoun refers to in a sentence.
